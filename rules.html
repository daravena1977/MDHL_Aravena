              100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in
              the state competition program that are unable to provide a field
              that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
              Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to
              inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a
              waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from
              leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an
